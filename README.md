Basic desktop app that might help to make occasional backups.

## Getting Started

This app runs on Java 8+. There is a list of backup items to add that have a source target (directory to copy) and destinations to copy the files to that/those destinations. A backup is created by clicking the button "NOW".

The destinations look like the following: `T:\Backups\YYYY.MM.dd HH_mm`.
